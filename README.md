# Codex
 ## A simple process for recording notes in markdown from the command line.

 ### Origin
 #### The idea for Codex came from this excellent 4 part write up and code repo from Scott Shipp (@scottashipp).
   - Post: https://dev.to/scottshipp/an-amazing-note-taking-system-with-markdown-and-git-part-1-48b1
     - In his posts he describes all of the issues, I've faced taking digital notes over the years.
   - Repo: https://github.com/scottashipp/noted
   - Scott is an open-source software and Java guru, I work in .Net, Azure, and Microsoft tech, because of a comfort level with PowerShell and it's cross platform capabilities his work inspired this implemention of similar but seperate features in PowerShell Core.

### Goal
#### The overall goal of Codex is to provide a simple way to take and make use of your notes
  - Powershell functions implemented as command line interface features make this possible.
