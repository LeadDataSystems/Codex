# Codex
 - A simple process for recording notes in markdown from the command line.
 - The idea for Codex came from this excellent 4 part write up and code repo from Scott Shipp.
   - Post: https://dev.to/scottshipp/an-amazing-note-taking-system-with-markdown-and-git-part-1-48b1
     - In his posts he describes all of the issues, I've faced taking digital notes over the years.
   - Repo: https://github.com/scottashipp/noted
- This inspired me to implement similar features in PowerShell Core.  
- The overall goal of Codex is to provide a simple way to take and use your notes
  - Powershell functions implemented as command line interface features make this possible.
